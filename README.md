# Fire-Detection
 Python-based deep learning project for fire detection in images, designed to complement traditional fire detection systems. It utilizes Keras, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to construct and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a dataset categorized into two classes: fire and no-fire.
